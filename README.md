**TajGEM** (Tajikistan Glacier Evolution Model) is a regional framework for simulating glacier mass balance and retreat dynamics in Central Asia.  
It integrates climate reanalysis (ERA5), RGI glacier inventories, and ensemble machine learning models to predict glacier evolution under future scenarios.

### 🔬 Key Features
- **Ensemble ML Models:**   
- **Geospatial Inputs:** slope, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), PGA, Arias intensity, and ERA5-based climate forcing.  
- **SHAP Explainability:** Model-agnostic feature attribution for interpretability.  
- **Regional Focus:** Central Asia.  
- **Open Data:** Designed to integrate RGI, GloGEMflow, and Central Asian glacier inventories.

### 📊 Current Objectives
- Generate regional susceptibility maps of glacier retreat and potential hazard zones.  
- Explore hybrid physics–ML coupling for glacier mass balance evolution.  
- Build a reproducible open-source pipeline for future climate scenarios (CMIP6).
